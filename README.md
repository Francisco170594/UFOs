# UFOs

## Overview of Project
Creating a web page with dynamic tables for a more in depth analysis of UFO's sightings and allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. I'll be creating table filters for the date field as well as other columns like city, state, country and shape.

## Results

Inside the webpage there's a table containing all the UFO sighting data (as seen in the image above). To the left of it, we find five search criteria (date, city, state, country and shape).
Whenever the user enters text on the search boxes (any), hits enter or clicks on the filter table button, a new table will appear showing all the UFO's sighting that match the description. Lets use Texas (tx) for example.

As we can see, only four sightings were recordes in 2010 in that state.

Now, if there's interest about sightings with triangle shaped UFO's, we enter "triangle" on the shape search box, and a new table is created.

## Summary: Cons and suggestions

- Drawback: You can't use more than one filter at the time. Only the last filter entered will create a new table

- Recommendations
   1. Allow the user two, three or all filters for a more precise search
   2. Add links of the original reports on each sighting for further investigation
