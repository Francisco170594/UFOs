# UFOs

## Overview of Project: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
Creating a web page with dynamic tables for a more in depth analysis of UFO's sightings and allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. I'll be creating table filters for the date field as well as other columns like city, state, country and shape.



## Results: Describe to Dana how someone might use the new webpage by walking her through the process of using the search criteria. Use images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation.



## Summary: In a summary statement, describe one drawback of this new design and two recommendations for further development.
